    <h2>Cool Finds</h2>
   <p>There are awesome art instalments all over Little Rock that deserve to have everyone's attention, but nothing is cooler than those secret spots. There is an old telephone booth where you can donate an old book and maybe take a different one with you if you're so inclined.</p>
